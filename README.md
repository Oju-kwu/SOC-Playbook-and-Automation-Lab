### 1.2 Escalation Paths

- Define when and how incidents escalate.
- Ensure low-impact events that evolve are appropriately handled.
- Create clear documentation and response flows.

### 1.3 Logging Configuration

- **Login System Logging:** Maintain logs (Active Directory, VPN, etc.) for minimum 90 days.
- **Secure Log Storage:** Use SIEM systems to store logs and prevent tampering.

---

## 2. Detection and Analysis

- Analyze logs for suspicious activity (e.g., excessive logins, malware indicators).
- Identify entry points, attack vectors, and compromised data.
- Investigate using:
  - Endpoint and app behavior
  - Email system queries
  - Network and access anomalies
- Review behavior and access to sensitive systems like OneDrive, Google Drive, SharePoint, etc.

### Sample Incident Scenarios

#### Incident 1 â€“ Brute Force / Credential Harvesting

| **CIA Category** | **Compromise Type** | **Business Impact** | **Risk Level** |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| C, I             | Privileged Account   | Yes                  | High           |

Evidence: Repeated failed login attempts and logins from various IPs using different passwords.

---

#### Incident 2 â€“ Insider Threat

| **CIA Category** | **Compromise Type** | **Business Impact** | **Risk Level** |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| C, I             | Privileged Account   | Yes                  | Medium         |

Evidence: Abnormal employee behavior, large file transfers, visiting malicious sites.

---

#### Incident 3 â€“ Phishing

| **CIA Category** | **Compromise Type** | **Business Impact** | **Risk Level** |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| C                | Privileged Account   | Yes                  | High           |

Evidence: Suspicious email with phishing links, spelling errors, and odd addresses.

## 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

### Containment
These steps in containment should be followed cautiously and carried out based on the kind of attack and the response that best handles the compromise.
**Immediate Actions:**
- Lock compromised accounts, reset passwords, enforce MFA.
- Block phishing sources and suspicious domains.
- Disable unauthorized accounts.
- Preserve evidence: logs, screenshots, files.

**Long-Term Actions:**
- Use forensic tools for deeper analysis.
- Monitor activity via IDS/SIEM.
- Analyze malware with tools like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis.

### Eradication

- Identify the root cause of the malware; phishing,
- Remove the malicious files and processes identified on the infected systems.
- Use antivirus and anti-malware tools to scan and clean the affected
  endpoints.
- Update all software and apply necessary patches to address vulnerabilities
 exploited by the attackers.
- Ensure the latest security updates are installed on all systems.
# Credential Reset:
- Reset passwords for compromised accounts and ensure multi-factor
  authentication (MFA) is enforced.
- Monitor for any suspicious account activities post-incident.
- Disable the compromised account and isolate affected systems.
- Scan and clean affected systems using antivirus and anti-malware tools.
- Close firewall ports and network connections that were used during the attack.

- Return any systems that were taken offline to production.
-  Close network access previously used by the attackers and reset passwords for affected accounts.
- Download and apply the latest security patches to address any vulnerabilities exploited during the incident.
- Conduct a vulnerability analysis to ensure that all identified issues have been resolved.
- Inform employees about the recovery process and any changes made.
- Share recovery information externally through appropriate channels
- Continue to monitor for any signs of malicious activity related to the incident to ensure that the threat has been fully eradicated.



## 4. Post-Incident Activities
